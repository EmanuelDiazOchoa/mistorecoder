Project `src/` structure added by automation.

Helpful notes:
- Fill in `src/config/firebase.ts` with real config
- Implement `navigation/StackNavigator.tsx` and `TabNavigator.tsx` with `react-navigation`
- Add reducers to `src/store/store.ts`
- Replace placeholder services with real API calls

Files added: api/, assets/, components/, config/, hooks/, navigation/, screens/, store/, types/, utils/, styles/
